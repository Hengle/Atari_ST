Misc Atari ST stuff

Between 1989 and 1994 I did some code, pics and demos on the Atari ST.

Around 1995 I moved to the PC and stopped programming on the ST.

Around 1997 I did a backup of about 130 / 140 Atari ST disks - porting them to the PC and burning them to a CD.
Then I entirely forgot about it.

This is a copy of this backup. I looked at it recently and decided to upload it to GitHub because:
- it's safer than my old CDs
- turns out some people still active on the ST might be interested.

I wanted to organize the whole thing in a better way but I just don't have time. So, you're on your own.

This is about 1% of the disks I have in the basement. No time for more. I know for a fact that some source code got lost. At some
point I gave some of the disks to friends who wanted to have a look at the code - and they never gave them back. At some point I
needed some space and I was out of floppies, so I just saved some new code over some old code, losing it forever. It also looks
like some of the files I got from this initial backup got corrupted back in 1997 already. Oh well.
