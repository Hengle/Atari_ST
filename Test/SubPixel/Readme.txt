Test of subpixel accuracy on the ST.

Press F1 to start moving the cube, F1 to pause again.

Press TAB to disable subpixel, release TAB to enable again.

The difference is especially obvious on a slowly vertically moving object.

Nothing much to see so far, just a proof of concept.

Code is not optimized etc.
