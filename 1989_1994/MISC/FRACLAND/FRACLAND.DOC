1. Introduction
---------------   
    The word FRACTAL was coined by Benoit B Mandelbrot in his book 'The 
Fractal Geometry of Nature'. It is used to describe objects which exhibit the 
property of self-similarity. An object is said to be self-similar if its 
structure does not vary under magnification. For example a branch from a tree 
has a similar structure to the whole tree, a twig has much in common with the 
branch and so on right down to the smallest twigglet. The vast majority of 
objects in nature defy definition in terms of circles and squares but it is 
readily apparent that they are self-similar. Mandelbrot and his successors have 
described several ways in which this property of self-similarity may be
exploited in order to mimic nature. Building from simple algorithms convincing
clouds, trees, coast lines, mountains and many other natural phenomena.

    This program 'FRACLAND' is  concerned with realistic modelling of fractal 
mountains. It goes beyond producing the data which describes the landscape and 
allows you to shade it, produce three dimensional views and even generate 
animation depicting journeys through your fictitious mathematical worlds.


2. Quick Start
--------------
    For those to impatient to read the manual here is the quick guide to 
getting a few pictures out of FRACLAND. Before you can really get the best out 
of FRACLAND you will need to spend a little time getting to know your way around
the various functions, but producing a simple animation can be done in a few 
minutes, as we are about to find out....

P.S. If you have a half meg ST you will need to have a blank formatted disc
     ready.

     1.   Creating a contour map.
          -----------------------
          Double click on FRACLAND.PRG and at the first dialogue click on the 
          'Generate' button. Now enter 169 in the 'Random Seed' field and press
          return. This will draw a contour map.

     2.   Drawing a 3D view of the contour.
          ---------------------------------
          Click on the menu entry marked '3D View'. This will display the Key
          Frame dialogue, click on the button marked 'Visual'. Use the mouse
          to select a view (left mouse button switches between move and tilt).
          Once you are happy with the outline press the space bar to return to
          the desktop and press return to draw the view. You can switch between 
          the view screen and the desktop by pressing any key or by left mouse
          clicking on the desktop. 

     3.   Generating an animation.
          ------------------------
          Click on the menu entry marked 'Load Story' and selected the file
          DEMO.STR which should have been supplied with FRACLAND. Now click on 
          the menu entry marked 'Do Rendering', this will display an alert 
          asking whether you want to shade the contour before drawing the 
          animation. If you click on 'Yes' the animation will look much better 
          but the calculating the shade data will take about 6 minutes before
          drawing commences. If there is not enough room to hold the animation
          in memory you will be asked to supply a file name (insert that blank
          disk!). The program will now draw 9 frames of animation.
          
     4.   Playing an animation.
          ---------------------
          If the animation was not saved to disk then click on the menu entry
          marked 'Play Back' to see the results. Press the space bar to exit
          from playback.
          If the animation was saved to disc then quit from FRACLAND and double 
          click on FRACPLAY.PRG now click on the button marked 'Load' and select
          the file you saved the animation to in FRACLAND. Press the return key 
          to see the end result.

     This should have given you a taste of what FRACLAND is all about, to 
improve the image quality try shading, increasing the detail, adding friction 
and adjusting the zone heights and colours. I hope you enjoy playing with this
program, who knows you may even be tempted to read the instructions!

3. Generating Landscapes
------------------------
    The contour map consists of 16,384 height measurements, this describes 
the fractal and as such is the fundamental data set in FRACLAND. Each time a 
contour map is to be generated you will be presented with the Contour 
Parameters dialogue, this has four items which describe the contour, each
parameter is explained below.

    Firstly we must initialise the random number generator by 'seeding' it. 
The seed is a four digit number used as a starting point for the random number 
generator, thus the same seed will produce the same sequence of random numbers 
and hence the same contour (although the contour may be modified by using the 
other parameters). It is considered correct etiquette to supply birthdays etc 
as a seed values. However for the more pragmatic, a random 'random seed' 
may be generated by pressing the button marked 'R'.

    The distribution of random numbers may be either uniform or normal. To 
produce accurate fractals normal deviation should be used, this produces 
rounded and more realistic contours. However setting distribution to uniform 
will generate a contour about 5 times as fast. You can set the distribution 
by clicking on the small button next to the distribution graph of your choice.

   The Fractal Dimension determines the ruggedness of the resulting 
contour. For a landscape this must lie between 2 and 3. The fractal dimension 
describes how the flat 2 dimensional surface invades 3 dimensional space. At the
extremes a fractal dimension of 2 would produce a completely flat contour and a 
fractal dimension of 3 would produce a contour which undulated violently, 
effectively filling 3 dimensions. Most earthly landscapes exhibit a fractal 
dimension of between 2.0 and 2.4, from rolling pastures to craggy mountains.

    The Initial Deviation is the amount by which the contour is allowed to move 
above or below the initial flat plane. The default value of 128 gives a good,
lifelike result. Raising the initial deviation will give high mountains and 
deep ravines, lowering the value gives flatter landscapes.

    The algorithm used to generate the contour is Mid-point Displacement. See
appendix 3 for further reading. 


4. Generating 3D views
----------------------

    Once a contour has been generated it can be displayed as a 3D projection by 
clicking on the '3D View' menu entry. This will display the key frame dialogue. 
The left three fields hold the coordinates of the observer (the origin is the 
centre of the contour). The three fields to the right hold the pitch, roll and 
yaw respectively.

    To make the process of setting the view coordinates easier, two visual 
methods are available.

    1. Clicking on the button marked 'From Map' will allow you to position the
       camera and set the line of sight by marking points on the contour map.
       After you have used the mouse to select two points a dialogue will be 
       displayed showing their heights and allowing them to be adjusted. (It is
       recommended that you always add about 5 to the height of the camera, this
       gives a more natural perspective than having your eye at ground level)

    2. Clicking on the 'Visual' button will switch into real time, wire frame 
       mode. This facility allows the position of the 3D view to be set by 
       roaming over the current contour using the mouse. The left mouse button
       switches between forward/backward and up/down. The right mouse draws a  
       low detail solid landscape. 'I' switches the instrumentation on/off. 
       'D' switches the amount of detail. The space bar exits wire frame mode 
       and places the coordinates of the wire frame view into the key frame
       dialogue. For small movements the arrow keys simulate the mouse
       movements.

    You can repeat either process or edit the values as much as you like, 
checking the results in wire frame by using the visual button. Once you have a 
satisfactory view you can draw it by pressing the OK button. The drawing 
process may be abandoned by pressing the ESC key. The quality of the result 
will depend on a) whether the contour has been shaded and b) the amount of 
detail set. For more information see the menu entries GENERATE, DETAIL and 
SHADE.

5. Fracland Modes
-----------------
    For maximum flexibility the animation facilities in FRACLAND have two modes
of operation 'MEMORY' and 'DISC'. The mode determines where the large animation
files are to be held. This information is used by the 'PLAYBACK' and
'DO RENDERING' options. In 'DISC' mode you will be prompted for a file name,
however in 'MEMORY' mode all data will be held in RAM. The mode may be switched
 at any time by using the menu entry marked 'MODE'.

    'MEMORY MODE' - all animation will be generated in memory allowing it to be
played back at up to 24 frames per second. You can load and save animation but 
any attempt to load an animation that is larger than the available memory will 
fail. The total number of frames available is displayed when you switch from 
'DISC' to 'MEMORY' and the number of animation frames left is displayed at the 
bottom of the 'STORY BOARD' dialogue. Unfortunately 'MEMORY MODE' is not 
available on 520 machines (save animation to disc and use FRACPLAY instead).

     'DISC MODE' - all frames of animation are saved directly to a disc file.
They may be played back straight from disc or loaded into the separate utility 
FRACPLAY which can hold approximately 9 more frames of animation than FRACLAND. 
It also means that hard disc users can generate very large animation sequences 
and play them back at reasonable speed directly from disc (17 frames a second on
my Quantum LP52S). Not all options are available when playing back from disc, 
see the entry on 'PLAY SPEED' for more details.
 
6. Generating Animation
-----------------------
    To generate animation FRACLAND must first be given the start and end views, 
and the number of frames of animation between the two. It will then calculate a 
flight path between these points and automatically draw the intervening frames. 
This method of animation is known as TWEENing. The start and end frames are 
known as KEY frames, a key frame is a view defined by the animator that MUST 
form part of the flight path. You are not restricted to just two key frames, you
can specify up to nine and FRACLAND will formulate a path which visits each in 
turn, thus allowing very complex animation to be described. You must also supply
the number of frames it takes to travel between each pair of key frames, in 
animation speak this is the number of TWEENS. Thus the number of frames in an 
animation is the sum of all tweens. In 'MEMORY mode this total must not exceed 
the available memory.

    A sequence of key frames and tween sizes in known as a STORY, you can enter 
the details of an animation by clicking on the STORY BOARD menu entry. The Story
Board dialogue has nine mountain icons and eight arrows, each mountain icon is 
an animation key frame, each arrow holds the number of frames between the key 
frames on either side. Clicking on a mountain icon will display the key frame 
details dialogue into which the coordinates should be entered, this is the same
dialogue as used to generate a single 3D view and the fields and buttons are 
described in the section GENERATING 3D VIEWS. Clicking on an arrow will display
the tween details dialogue, the number of tween frames may be adjusted by 
clicking on the dialogue arrow buttons. The end of a story is indicated by a 
tween value of 0.

    You may copy the coordinates of one key frame to another by using the copy 
button, first click on the copy button, then the frame you wish to copy from, 
followed by the frame your copying to. Hint - copying the first frame to the 
last will make the animation loop smoothly.

    Once you have decided on the key frames and tween values you may preview the
animation in wire frame by clicking on the 'Preview' button. This allows 
adjustments to be made before committing to a full rendering (you can exit 
preview mode by pressing the SPACE bar or the left mouse button). Once you are 
happy with the preview you can render the animation by clicking on the 'DO 
RENDERING' menu entry. This will display a dialogue detailing the current status
of the render which may be stopped at any time by pressing the 'ESC' key.

7. Menu Entries
---------------
  FILE
     SAVE VIEW
                      To save the CURRENT VIEW as a standard DEGAS 
                      picture click on the SAVE VIEW and supply a file name
                      and path in the file selector. You can display the 
                      CURRENT VIEW before saving by pressing any key or by
                      left clicking on the desk top.

     LOAD CONTOUR
                      This option will allow you to load contours from disc.
                      For information on what details are loaded please see
                      the SAVE CONTOUR menu entry description. Once the contour
                      has been loaded a short wait will occur whilst the 
                      CONTOUR MAP is redrawn. CONTOUR files should have the
                      extension '.CON'

     SAVE CONTOUR
                      When you have found a contour that you are happy with 
                      and have decided on the position and colour of CONTOUR
                      ZONES it may be saved to disc. You may specify the
                      path and file name in the file selector box, the file
                      will be given the extension '.CON'. CON files hold 
                      the shape of the contour, colour and zone information,
                      the amount of detail required and the shading data,
                      if shading has been done. Saving this information 
                      to disc for your favourite landscapes will save time as 
                      it can take up to 10 minutes to generate, shade and draw
                      a complex contour. Saved contour files may also be loaded
                      at startup rather than generating from scratch each time.
                      
     LOAD STORY
                      The path taken through the landscape by an animation
                      is defined by the STORY BOARD. The details of this path
                      may be loaded from disc into the STORY BOARD by
                      clicking on the LOAD STORY menu entry. The appropriate
                      file may then be selected from the file selector.
                      STORY files should have the extension '.STR'
                      If the STORY being loaded has more frames of animation
                      than can be held in memory the animation MODE will
                      automatically be switched to DISC. This will mean that
                      all animation is to be held on disc, not in memory.

     SAVE STORY
                      The current details held in the STORY BOARD may be
                      saved to disc by clicking on this menu item and
                      supplying a name in the file selector. The file will
                      automatically be given an extension of '.STR'

     LOAD ANIMATION
                      Animation may be loaded into memory by clicking on the
                      LOAD ANIMATION menu entry and specifying the name in
                      the file selector box. Animation files should have an
                      extension of '.ANn' where n = 1 for low resolution
                      and 3 for high. Animation may only be loaded if the 
                      MODE is set to MEMORY. If the MODE is set to DISC then
                      the option will be offered to switch MODES or you may
                      play the animation straight from disc by using the
                      PLAYBACK menu option directly.
                      This action will fail if the animation was saved at a
                      different resolution or if it contains more frames
                      than can be fitted into memory. If the animation does
                      contain more frames than can be fitted into memory then
                      using the dedicated animation player FRACPLAY.PRG will
                      allow more frames to be loaded.

     SAVE ANIMATION
                      Once an animation has been created in memory by using
                      the 'DO RENDERING' option it may be saved to disc
                      using this menu entry. The name and path may be given 
                      in the file selector and an extension of '.ANn' will be
                      added, where n = 1 for low resolution and 3 for high. 
                      The file created will contain each frame of the
                      animation and the colour information. It may be loaded
                      back into memory using LOAD ANIMATION, played straight
                      from disc using PLAYBACK in DISC MODE or loaded into
                      the separate animation player program FRACPLAY.PRG


  CONTOUR

     GENERATE
                      This menu entry is used to generate a fractal landscape.
                      This is the fundamental set of data from which the 
                      contour map, 3 dimensional views and animation are 
                      generated. The concepts, algorithms and parameters used
                      to generate a landscape are explained in more detail
                      under the section on GENERATING LANDSCAPES. 
                      To produce a sample landscape click on the GENERATE
                      menu entry, this will display the dialogue for the
                      parameters used in generating the fractal. You can 
                      allow most of these to default, simply enter any number
                      in the field marked RANDOM SEED and click on the OK
                      button. Each SEED will grow a unique landscape.

     SHADE
                      Initially contour maps are coloured based on height above
                      sea level (as in most atlases). However to add more
                      realism you can shade the contour as though a light 
                      source was illuminating it. This helps to bring out the
                      relief of the contour. To shade a contour click on the
                      SHADE menu entry. This will display a progress dialogue
                      informing you  how much of the contour has been shaded. 
                      The process takes around six minutes to complete after
                      which the contour map will be redrawn shaded. The 
                      shading process may be stopped by pressing the ESC key.
                      A contour may be saved in its shaded form.
                      (For those interested the algorithm used is Lambert's
                      Cosine)
                      
     DETAIL
                      When a 3 dimensional view is generated the number of
                      polygons drawn governs the speed and detail. The more
                      polygons the more detail, less  polygons gives faster
                      drawing. This usually means that tests are drawn in rough
                      until the correct results are achieved when the detail
                      can be increased to produce the finished article. The
                      amount of detail can be adjusted by clicking on the
                      DETAIL menu entry, this will display a dialogue with four
                      buttons, the further to the left the button selected the
                      more detail drawn. A view drawn with minimum detail will
                      take approximately 10 seconds on a standard ST. Maximum
                      detail views take about 3 minutes each. Thus a 20 frame
                      animation at maximum detail will take about an hour to
                      produce.  
                       

     CONTOUR ZONES
                      Each contour is divided into land and sea. The land is
                      further divided into 3 zones. This gives a total of four
                      areas or zones the size of which may be varied as
                      required. Clicking on the CONTOUR ZONES menu entry will
                      produce a dialogue box, the percentage of the contour 
                      divided into sea, zone 1 and zone 3 should be entered.
                      If the percentages total more than 100 then they will
                      crowed each other out, in order of precedence - sea,
                      zone 1, zone 3, zone 2. 
                      Because the zones are based purely on height they
                      appear as straight lines on the 3D views, this can look
                      unnatural and to prevent it you may specify the percentage
                      of friction to be used when drawing zones 1 and 3.
                      Friction on a contour will mean that zones 1 and 3 will
                      'invade' the flatter areas of zone 2, just as snow 
                      will gather on flat ground at lower altitudes or trees
                      colonise higher ground if not to steep.
                      The contour zones set are also used when producing 3 
                      dimensional views.
                      (N.B. The only option available to mono users is to
                             adjust the SEA LEVEL)

     COLOURING
                      Each of the four zones and the sky is assigned a range
                      of colours. Clicking on the COLOURING menu entry in
                      low resolution will display the Zone Colours dialogue.
                      The colour of the sea may be set by selecting either Sea
                      or Ocean; the sky can be set by selecting Night, Blue Sky,
                      Hazy or Tropical. To change the colour of a land zone
                      first click one of the Zone buttons then choose a terrain
                      type from the array of buttons below. All changes to 
                      the colours are instantly reflected in the colour bar on
                      the top right of the dialogue (except the sky colour). To
                      observe the effect of your colour changes you can
                      display the last 3D view generated by clicking on the 
                      View button. (This will be a blank screen if no view
                      has been drawn). Although the ST only provides a palette
                      of 16 colours they are stippled to produce a total of 46
                      virtual colours. 
                      Clicking on the COLOURING menu entry in mono will
                      provide a dialogue to allow the background colour of 3 D
                      views to be selected as black or white. 

     3D VIEW
                      The current contour may be drawn as a 3 dimensional
                      projection. To produce a single 3D view you must click
                      on the 3D VIEW menu entry. This will display a dialogue
                      for the coordinates to be used and options to set them
                      using visual methods. For more detail on creating 3D
                      images see the section on GENERATING 3D VIEWS. Once
                      you are happy with the coordinates you can click on OK
                      to start the drawing process or CANCEL to abandon.
                      Clicking on OK will draw a progress report dialogue, when
                      the transformation and sort have finished the screen will
                      be switched to the CURRENT VIEW screen and the landscape
                      drawn. The process may be stopped at any time (except 
                      during the sort phase) by pressing the ESC key.


  ANIMATION

     PLAY BACK
                      Animation can be played using this menu option. In DISC
                      MODE clicking on PLAY BACK will produce a file selector
                      into which the name of an animation file (.ANn) should be 
                      entered. The file will then be played direct from disc.
                      In MEMORY MODE the animation will immediately start
                      playing. If no animation is held in memory then a 
                      warning will be given. The speed and direction of the play
                      back can be set using the PLAY SPEED menu entry detailed
                      below. You can stop an animation playing by left mouse
                      click or pressing the space bar.
                      You may also use the program FRACPLAY.PRG to play
                      animation generated by FRACLAND. FRACPLAY can generally
                      hold 9 more frames of animation in memory than can be
                      stored by FRACLAND. 

     STORY BOARD
                      To create an animation the path the 'camera' takes through
                      the landscape must be defined. The STORY BOARD menu entry
                      will display a dialogue box into which this path may be
                      entered. For more detail on the concepts involved see the
                      section on GENERATING ANIMATION.

     PLAY SPEED
                      The speed and direction an animation is played back may
                      be set by clicking on the PLAY SPEED menu item. This
                      will produce a dialogue. The entry marked SPEED (initially
                      set to 5) may be edited to give the delay used between
                      frames. 0 is the quickest at around 24 frames a second
                      from memory. Direction can be set to forward or reverse
                      and the animation mode may be LOOP or PING. If the
                      animation is to loop it will return directly to the start
                      frame on reaching the end. In ping mode on reaching the
                      end it will replay the frames in reverse order. Pinging
                      can produce a smoother animation sequence without a sudden
                      chop at the end. 
                      (N.B. Only the speed has any effect in DISC MODE)

     MODE
                      FRACLAND may be used in two modes DISC or MEMORY. The
                      mode dictates where animation is held. For more
                      information see the section on FRACLAND MODES. The MODE
                      may be changed at any time using the menu entry MODE. If
                      you try and switch to MEMORY MODE with more frames of
                      animation in the STORY BOARD than can be held in memory
                      an error will be given requesting the number be reduced.
                      Otherwise the number of frames that can be held in memory
                      will be displayed in an alert box.

     DO RENDERING
                      This menu entry draws the frames of an animation.
                      Once all the details of the animation sequence have been
                      entered into the STORY BOARD you can click on this option
                      to begin drawing the 3D animation frames. Each frame 
                      is preceded by a report dialogue which will indicate
                      how many frames have been drawn, how many are left 
                      and the progress of the frame currently being drawn.
                      Each frame will be written to disc or memory (depending
                      on the current MODE) after it has been drawn, ready to be 
                      played back on completion. The rendering may be stopped 
                      at any time by pressing the ESC key. If you have not
                      shaded the contour you will be given the opportunity
                      to do so before rendering commences, for more detail
                      on shading see the information on the SHADE menu entry
                      above. For more details on how to create animation
                      see the section on GENERATING ANIMATION. Please note that
                      the quality of the animation is dependant on the amount of
                      detail drawn, this may be set using the DETAIL menu entry.

    I hope you enjoy using FRACLAND its been fun writing and researching it. 
Watch out for new versions with PHOTOCHROME 19200 colour support, much larger 
contour maps and all sorts of other bits, when time (currently fully occupied by
a two month old daughter) allows.

P.S. Why the fish shaped mouse ? Its a bit of christian symbolism. Fractals are 
     ok but God does a much better job.
