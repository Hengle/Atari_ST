This folder contains the following files:

GIFSHOW.PRG - Atari ST GIF slide show program
GIFSHOW.DOC - This file
SATURN.GIF  - 32 color GIF picture

and other .GIF files

Please note that GIFSHOW needs to be run from MEDIUM or HIGH resolution.
Yes, this means that it *will* display in monochrome (and quite nicely
too, thank you).  It should successfully display *ALL* GIF files that you
will find on Compuserve.

To run GIFSHOW, simply double-click on it from the desktop.  It will
display a start-up screen, then automatically cycle through all GIF
files in the current directory.

You can control the display by pressing various keys, as follows:

Key:                        Effect:

Return      - terminates display after the current picture is finished

Space       - pauses display after the current picture is finished,
              press any key to continue

F1          - sets no delay between pictures

F2 - F10    - sets 1 to 9 second delay between pictures
              (F10 is longest)        

You can also use GIFSHOW to display individual files:
Use INSTALL APPLICATION from the GEM desktop, and install it
with file type '.GIF' - then double click on any GIF file, and
it will be displayed for you.

Acknowlegements:

The font used in the start-up screen was created with the FED font
editor by Reg Knighton.

The GIF expansion code was provided by Compuserve Inc. (Special thanks
to Steve Wilhite, Craig Knouf and Larry Wood)

The color palette conversions, high-speed line drawing interface, and
Halftoning for Monochrome display  are proprietary to Zaphodyne Inc.
If you are a registered GIF developer, and would like to use them i
your own software, drop us a line.

This program is written in C, using the Megamax C Development system
(which we highly reccomend) with in-line assemblor used in the low-level
drawing routines.
