				  ------------------------
				  
				  
	The slideshow program is based on the many others which are available
on the P.D. The keys for control are...

	F1-F10	>	Speed.	F1-Fast/F2-Slow
	SPACE		>	Freeze frame.
	RETURN	>	Continue.
	ESC		>	Quit.
	
	Other features include the ability to load Degas Elite 'PC1' and
Tiny 'TNY' formats, in case anyone wants to add intro or text screens.
	
	PCSVIEW can also load ICE-PACKED versions of the above screens.
Typically, TINY and PC1 screens are halved and PCS screens are reduced
by around 30%, ideal for slideshows since PCS files can be very large.
(minimum size about 20k and up to 102k max.)
