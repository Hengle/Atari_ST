                   Concept, Design and Programming

     You are now the proud owner of the PhotoChrome graphics card 
emulator. It is the only one of its type currently available for the 
Atari ST and is capable of out-performing all other screen modes 
including the infamous HAM and HalfBrite displays on the Commodore 
Amiga.
     It's basic specification is the ability to load most IFF formats, 
24-Bit True colour screens (16 million colours), GIF files and 
VidiChrome digitised 'RGB' colour separations (4096 colours) before
converting to one of six powerful screen modes.

*---------------------------------------------------------------------*

                        THE 6 CONVERSION MODES
                        ----------------------

        The six screen modes are...
        
1.      Spectrum 512   > 42/45 cols per scanline from 512 on an ST
                         or STE.

2.      Spectrum 4096  > 42/45 cols per scanline from 4096 on an STE.

3.      PCS-ST         > 48 colours per scanline from 512 on an ST
                         or STE.

4.      PCS-STE        > 48 colours per scanline from 4096 on an STE.

5.      Super HAM      > A full 4096 colours out of 4096 on an ST
                         or STE.

6.      STE PhotoChrome > 19200 colours out of 32768 on an STE.
        
     Modes 1 and 2 are basically real Spectrum-512 files. They are not 
compressed, but Spectrum can do this if you need it. STE mode seems to 
handle pictures better than I had expected, since with such a large 
palette the colour assignments tend to be used up twice as quickly.

     Modes 3 and 4 are my own custom versions of the Spectrum display. 
They both have a few extra colours to play with, filling up the streaks 
and dots Spectrum can often leave behind. This is my own 'PCS' format 
(PhotoChrome Screen) and uses the best of 2 compression methods.

     Modes 5 and 6 are actually impossible, so just accept they work 
and don't ask too many questions!

     SUPER HAM is an emulation of the Hold And Modify mode normally 
exclusive to the Commodore Amiga. After some experimentation with my 
own Amiga, I found that HAM is not actually as capable of displaying 
€some of the more detailed colour images (especially with high levels of 
contrast or lots of sharp lines) and so renamed my own format 'SUPER 
HAM'. Many HAM pictures are of course better as they have many more 
colours per line, but have to smudge and blend to obtain them.

     PHOTOCHROME is only available when the source picture contains in 
excess of 4096 colours (i.e. QRT 16-million colour pictures), and then 
only to STE owners. However, if you do have an STE and some RAW files 
knocking about (STF cover disk 35!) then you are in for a treat indeed! 
Eat your heart out, VGA! This is the most powerful mode available short 
of a real Graphics card, with 19200 colours on-screen at once from a 
largish palette of 32768! (15-bit colour). The picture requires two 
conversion passes, but is well worth the wait!

     N.B. Pictures saved out as Super HAM or PhotoChrome tend to be 
anywhere from large to enormous, even with fancy compression. Bear this 
in mind when testing out the hatched and fractal stippling options! 
(Check out PCSVIEW.DOC for info on better compression...)

*---------------------------------------------------------------------*

                               FEARURES
                               --------

1>      STIPPLING.            (COLOUR REDUCTION ONLY)

     Generally, if the source picture holds more colours than the 
destination format (i.e. RAW > SPU) then you are allowed stippling. 
The three options are CLEAN - just leave the picture as it is, HATCHED 
- use levels of hatching to make up in-between colours and FRACTAL - 
the weird one. This uses fractal numbers to highlight/leave each pixel 
on the screen, the result being that graduated colours look more obvious 
but you get a weird 'oil-painting' effect. It really only works well 
in PhotoChrome and super-HAM modes.

2>      ERROR/FLICKER FREE.   (SUPER HAM/PHOTOCHROME ONLY)

     Error-free mode makes a better job of mega-colourful pictures 
but is not normally needed (a sort of last-resort). 'Flicker-free' 
should be used where available, the only problem being that it chews 
through the colour tables at an alarming rate (keep an eye on QRT 
screens). N.B. STE PhotoChrome mode is fixed at ERROR-FREE in 60Hz, 
since flicker is minimal with such a large palette.

FLICKER-FREE mode CAN sometimes reduce the quality of the screen...

3>      50/60 Hz MODES.       (SUPER HAM and QRT PICTURES ONLY)

     Basically, everything runs at 50Hz, with a couple of exceptions. 
QRT pictures tend to have a 60Hz aspect ratio (not fixed but the option 
is there) causing the screen to look squashed at 50Hz. Also, PHOTOCHROME 
mode looks best at 60Hz anyway, so it is left as the default frequency. 
60Hz also helps when 'flicker-free' option has been avoided for 
accuracy. To change the default, click on the 50Hz button. All screens 
will now run at 50Hz regardless of how they might look. To switch modes 
while viewing the picture, hit the '*' key.

4>      SPECTRUM OPTIONS.

     Spectrum 512 does not use all of it's available colours. Colour 0 
€(background colour) is always black and colour 15 is reserved for drawing 
and for the mouse pointer etc. leaving 14 variable colours for use in the 
picture. There are 3 palette changes per line meaning (16-2)*3 or 42 
cols available for alteration on each individual scanline of the 
screen. The 'LEGAL COLOURS' option uses just these colours. The 'ALL 
COLOURS' option however releases colour 15 for use, meaning (16-1)*3 or 
45 cols per line. The only disadvantage is that Spectrum will crack up 
if you try to load them in. Any pixels using colour 15 will turn bright 
orange and look a right mess. You have been warned... (N.B. slideshows 
should display these pictures no probs.)

*---------------------------------------------------------------------*

                              LIMITATIONS
                              -----------

     Hmmm, I'm not sure there are any, really..
        
     No, seriously, there are a few bits you should know about before 
creating slideshows full of pretty pictures!

     1> RAW's
        
     QRT screens can be any width or height (<=320*200) and will be 
centred on the screen with a black border. If you use the 'flicker-
free' option (SUPER HAM only) some loss of detail or palette-errors 
might occur on very complex pictures. To avoid this you may have to use 
the 'error-free' mode instead (at 60Hz there is very little flicker 
anyway). To cut down any flicker you may still see, reduce the contrast 
setting on your monitor.

        2> GIF's
        
     The program can load GIF's of any height or width and will offer 
the option to either squash the picture, or select a 320*200 zone. 
320*200 GIF's will bypass this stage. To select a zone, use the arrow-
keys and 'SPACE' when satisfied.

        2> IFF's
        
     The program can load ILBM IFF's of any height or width but will 
crop them to 320*200 (a later version will contain squash/interlace 
options). The real bonus is that it eats up colours like nothing else. 
All of the Amiga pictures I fed it looked identical to the originals, 
with no loss of colour or detail! (HalfBrite 64 colour IFF's are 
supported properly)

        3> RGB's
        
     VidiChrome RGB screens suffer from very few limitations. Generally 
you should choose the 'flicker-free' option all the time and if you 
spot dots/errors on the screen (rare) you can resort to 60Hz and 
'error-free' mode.

        4> SYNC PROBLEMS.
        
     It came to my attention some time ago that both Spectrum-512 and 
GFA Raytrace suffered from video-synchronisation problems. This caused 
very irritating little dots or vertical lines to appear from time to 
time and totally ruin the effect of the picture. It was also very 
€embarrasing when trying to show off the ST's capabilities to other 
members of the computer world (i.e. Amiga-people). These programs 
are supplied with a 'SYNC.PRG' which, contrary to many peoples beliefs 
does sod-all to fix the problem. All it does is TELL you whether your 
ST is READY to display a picture or NOT, having no effect on the 
machine at all. The only way to rectify a 'no-sync' situation is to 
TURN OFF and reboot, resetting the video-clock hardware and hopefully 
reversing the situation. Generally it takes a few tries before success, 
and although I have seen a few ST's that ALWAYS boot up properly, the 
effect on STE's is generally quite bad (just try to merge a colour 
digitised picture in 4096 colour mode in VidiChrome and you'll probably 
see what I mean).
     Anyway, Since my own display code incorporates similar colour-
switch techniques, PhotoChrome was initially prone to this bugging 
effect. After a lot of work and an equal amount of problems it has been 
solved, and as far as I know, is rectified on all ST's and STE's. All 
pictures saved out from PhotoChrome (including Spectrum-512/4096) are 
'immunised' against sync problems, regardless of which slideshow 
program you choose to display them (they even load into Spectrum 
itself! Although if you mess about with the picture, Spectrum will re-
assign the colours and destroy the immunised structure of the screen.

*---------------------------------------------------------------------*

                           SAVING A PICTURE
                           ----------------
                                   
     To save a screen, hit 'RETURN' or 'S' once it has been converted
and is being displayed. The file will take a few seconds to compress
before giving you a file selector. The program will check diskspace
prior to saving the screen.
     To switch 50/60 Hz on the same screen, hit the '*' key. This will
be recorded into the file for displaying in the slideshow.
     While selecting a part of a GIF picture, use the arrow keys and 
'SPACE' when done.


*------------------------------------------------------------------------*

                           SHAREWARE THEORY

                      --------------------------
                      (or, at least, Dug's View!)
                      --------------------------
                                
     If you know what Shareware is, then you can skip the next 200 odd
bytes of text and read the next paragraph instead.
        
     The idea behind Shareware is actually quite simple...

     Someone writes a program and gives it to someone, they either 
dislike it, like it or love it. The people who dislike it don't use the 
thing, and therefore certainly don't pay for it. Of the ones who do 
like the program, MOST will feel it is worthwhile paying for, and SOME 
will actually make donations to the author. Of the people who really 
like it, most will probably make a donation, and will also recommend 
and LEGALLY spread it to their friends, helping the author even more. 
Basically, everybody's happy, although the whole thing does rely on one 
thing being present somewhere along the line, that being HONESTY. It is 
a risky thing to depend on the public's honesty to make a living, but 
€in a situation like this, the usual motives for piracy are gone. Nobody 
can feel cheated by shareware, since you pay for the software alone and 
not the blurb normally supplied by the 'houses' with their 'spacious' 
packaging and price-upping bound-manuals.

        There is an attractive list of facts...

1 -  It kills piracy, since you can't pirate something you're TRYING
     to spread anyway! Spreading actually helps shareware by bringing
     it to other people's attention.
        
2 -  You don't need to spend money on advertising. If it's good, it
     will tend to get about on it's own. (A review or two always helps
     start the ball rolling!)

3 -  Customers only pay for what they use, they CANNOT be conned or
     cheated into buying software which is no use. They get as much
     time to evaluate it as they like, hopefully resulting in a small
     donation to the author.

*       PhotoChrome and Shareware                                    *
*--------------------------------------------------------------------*

     This program was a lot of work, but I do think it was worthwhile. 
It's about time the ST started to antagonise the other machines
normally hogging the world of fancy graphics and sound.
     PhotoChrome was written during 1 month of intensive programming
and testing and it would be nice to see some sort of return for my
work. A donation of about œ2.00 - œ5.00 would suffice, and I am also
anxious to know of peoples thoughts on the program. The more donations
I recieve the more incentive I will have to continue with the series
and produce updates.
     As a little temptation, I am thinking of doing a something very
special with the SUPER HAM and PHOTOCHROME modes. I have analysed the
idea and it seems feasible. It will depend obviously on the support I
recieve from this, (if it's not going to make me anything, it's an
awful lot of wasted time!) but I will make a start on it anyway.

     If anyone is thinking seriously of writing a rendering package
for the ST/E machines, then please consider these screen formats as 
worthwhile for inclusion. There is nothing worse than having an
exceptional package held back by a low-quality output such as
16-colours or a badly rastered screen!

*------------------------------------------------------------------------*

                               SOURCE (and grovelly bit)
                               ------
         A new file format is absoultely no use without software
     to utilise it or available source for programmers to use
     themselves. It is also annoying when the only type of source
     available is an object or 'BIN' file instead of a listing
     which greatly limits what you can do with it, unless you set
     about disassembling it yourself. This, I think stems from
     programmers being paranoid about other people seeing their code
     and so, try to protect it by hiding it from others. This helps
     nobody.

         I have decided to supply the documented source for the
€     PCSVIEW slideshow on disk for œ5.00 (see the address at bottom
     of text) There is a need for the format to become a standard
     (like Spectrum) and therefore needs to be widely available to
     programmers. Please remember that this whole package is far more
     powerful than anything of it's kind, and I'm making it available
     for next to nothing!

                           THE PIXEL TWINS
                           ---------------

*-----------------------------------------------------------------------*
*       And the plugs and stuff start here...                                   *
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------*

        A few last words...
        
     The Pixel Twins are a group of programmers/artists/enthusiasts 
who produce bits and bobs for the ST/E machines. We do utilities, 
demos, slideshows and other various thingies you would not normally 
find in the shops.


The Pixel Twins (and people for me to thank) are...

 Douglas Little (DML)    - 68000 programmer/sometimes graphics artist.
                           I write most of the P.T. 68000 stuff.
                                          
 Noel Wallace   (NOD)    - general ST enthusiast/artist/video man.
                           lots of contacts, lots of info, lots of
                           videotapes, churns out some nice colour
                           dig-pics and lots of his own too...

 Andrew Younger (Highlander)     (well, he does live in inverness...)
                         - 68000 Programmer.
                           Does plenty of ST and STE demo bits.
                           currently helping me (and me helping him)
                           with the next STE project.
                                                  
 P.C. Matthews  (PCM)    - STOS programmer/abstract artist.
                           Does things in STOS most people have
                           difficulty with in Assembly.
                           Also has a soft spot for GFA Raytrace and
                           QRT. This is the man responsible for
                           the very strange RAW files supplied
                           to the ST Format offices.
                           (many thanks for your demo piccys, Phil!).

 Lorraine Davidson (LD)  - Keeps everyone in check. (esp. NOD)

 ED.                     - Also a STOS man, and learning 68000
                           at the same time at a phenominal rate...

 EGGG.                   - The PC owning artist and musician.
      
     I would also like to thank Kevin Ramage for the use of his 
VidiChrome - ST and his GST-GOLD Genlock/Splitter hardware which 
€made the bug testing and solving possible. It also helped produce
the demo slideshows much needed for showing off this final version
of the program. And thanks to Martin East who supplied some Amiga
piccys for testing

*+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*


     Here is a list (not comprehensive) of some of the other things
we have done...

                              UTILITIES
                              ---------
        
     There is a Pixel Twins utilities disk floating around on the P.D.
containing a few bits and bobs. Of the most useful are the Graphics
package, 'TecBrush' and the custom STOS-3D extension (apparently it
is about 4-5 times faster than the real STOS-3D but you have to use
CAD-3D or SCULPT to make the objects and a custom utility supplied
to re-colour, optimise and shade them before use. There is also an old
version of the disk which should be avoided at all costs...
A fresh TPT Utilities Disk will be re-released containing new proggies
and updated versions of PhotoChrome and associated slideshows etc.
soon.

                                          DEMOS
                                          -----

1>   MENTAL HANGOVER (THE PIXEL TWINS SCOOPEX CONVERSION)
     1 Meg STE only.
        
     I'm quite proud of this one really, so I won't slag it off (yet).               
If you want to see what a 1meg STE demo should look like, get this.
It has so far had 2 excellent magazine reviews and last time I looked,
was number 4 in the top ST demo list! (P.D. Magazine).

2>   STUPENDOUS DEMO.
     ST+STE,Half meg, Partially STE-only.

     Another one of those P.D. show-off jobs containing no more point 
or reason than an episode of 'Emmerdale farm' but lots of fun to watch
and listen to.

3>   TPT CHRISTMAS DEMO
     Any ST/E.

     A very funny seasonal STOS put-together with free dancing
snowmen! Hmmmm...

4>   ZOOLOOKOLOGIE DEMO
     ST/STE/1MEG STE bits.

     Sample demo. I have heard it has been banned, but I am not yet 
sure. If it has, you won't be able to get it!

5>   Nod & PCM are working on another STOS demo, and I must admit, it 
     looks very good indeed.  (also works on anything)

€6>   This one's top secret. I am currently developing the most immense
     demonstration the STE (and even ST) has ever seen, and I am not
     joking...       1meg STE only.

7>   This one's so secret, I'm not going to say... It's a game anyway...
        
*---------------------------------------------------------------------*
*       End of plugs.                                                 *
*---------------------------------------------------------------------*

     Well, that's it! you can get back to reading your ST Format
     'cos I've run out of things to type. It's about time I got back
     to work anyway...
