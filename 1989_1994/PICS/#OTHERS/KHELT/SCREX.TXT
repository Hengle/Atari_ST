HELLO BOYZ AND GIRLZ (WHERE ARE YOU ALL GONE?). YOU DON'T KNOW BE BUT I 
KNOW YOU ALL, SO LET ME INTRODUCE MYSELF (HAVE TO BE PRETTY SUPPLE TO DO 
THAT, NO?): I'M KHELT, YES, KHELT AND I'M A PART-TIME GRAPHIST FOR 
HOLOCAUST AND A GFX-MAN OF FORTUNE FOR ANY OTHER CREW INTERESTED IN MY 
LITTLE PIXEL-CRAPS. ACCORDING TO ME (THAT IS THE ONE WITH WHO I AGREE MOST 
OF THE TIME) YOU ARE ALL IGNORANT ABOUT A FEW THINGS THAT I THINK TO BE 
VERY INTERSTING: TOLKIEN'S MYTHOLOGY. I MUST WARN YOU, IF SOMEONE SAYS: 
'WHO'S TOLKIEN' HIS TV SET WILL BLOW OUT, BURNING HIS FACE AWAY AND THAT 
WILL WHAT I CALL A FAIR BLOW! SO NOW SHUT UP AND LISTEN...     FIRST THERE 
WAS ERU WHO CREATED THE AINUR. THE MOST POWERFUL OF THEM ARE CALLED THE 
VALAR ( "POWERS OF THE WORLD" ) AND ARE 15. THEY ARE 7 LORDS : MANWE 
SULIMO IS LORD OF WINDS, LOVED BIRDS AND WORDS AND LEADED THE VALAR. ULMO 
IS LORD OF WATER AND SEAS, A GREAT FRIEND OF MANWE AND YOU CAN STILL HEAR 
THEM SINGING TOGETHER WHEN THE WEATHER IS RAINY. AULE IS THE LORD OF EARTH 
AND FIRE, HE'S THE FIRST SMITH BUT HE DO NOT KEEP HIS CREATIONS FOR HIM 
AND IS HAPPY TO GIVE THEM TO HIS FELLOWFRIENDS. MANDOS IS LORD OF DEATH, 
MEANING THAT HE LOOKED AFTER THE SOULS OF DEADS BUT HE CAN'T DECIDE OF THE 
MOMENT OF ONE'S DEATH. OROMOE IS THE LORD OF HUNT AND ANIMALS AND IS 
STRIDING THROUGH THE WORLD ON A WHITE HORSE CALLED NAHAR. LORIEN IS LORD 
OF DREAMS AND RESTING. TULKAS IS LORD OF FIGHT AND STRENGHT AND IS A GOOD 
FRIEND OF OROMOE.             THERE ARE ALSO 7 LADIES :  VARDA ( ALSO 
KNOWN AS ELBERETH GILTHONIEL "THE GIVER OF LIGHT" AMONGST ELVES ) IS THE 
LADY OF LIGHT AND HIS BEAUTY IS TO HIGH TO BE TOLD BY HUMAN WORDS. YAVANNA 
KEMENTARI IS LADY OF EVERYTHING THAT GROW FROM EARTH. NIENNA IS LADY OF 
SORROWS AND PAINS BUT SHE'S ALSO LADY OF CURE AND HOPE. OTHER LADIES ARE 
ESTE, VIARE, VANA AND NESSA.         THE LAST ONE IS MELKOR WHO HAD A PART 
OF THE POWER OF ALL THE VALAR AND SO HE WAS THE MOST POWERFUL OF THEM ALL, 
AND IN THE MIND OF ERU HE IS THE BROTHER OF MANWE.             SO CAME THE 
MOMENT WHEN ERU TAUGHT THE VALAR A GREAT MUSIC SO THAT THEIR CHORUS FILLED 
THE DARKNESS AND NOUGHT WAS NO LONGER EMPTY.          FROM THE MUSIC, ERU 
CREATED EA, THE EXISTING WORLD. BUT MELKOR STARTED TO SING FOR HIS OWN 
GLORY AND DISCORD WAS BROUGHT TO THE LAND. MELKOR WAS BANNISHED AND FROM 
THIS TIME HE HAS BEEN BEARING THE NAME OF MORGOTH ( "THE DARK ENEMY" ). 
FROM THEN ON, THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE EARTH IS A FOLLOWING OF HARD BATTLES 
BETWEEN THE FORCES OF GOOD (ELVES, DWARVES, NUMENOREANS, ETC...)AND THE 
FORCES OF MORGOTH (ORCS, GOBLINS, TROLLS, DRAGONS, ETC...).          THE 
WHOLE STORY IS DEPICTED IN FOUR BOOKS: THE SILMARILION, THE UNFINISHED 
TALES, THE HOBBIT AND OF COURSE THE LORD OF THE RINGS.             NOW I'M 
AFRAID IT'S CLOSE TO TIME TO WRAP BUT BEFORE EVERYTHING IS OVER, JUST 
REMEMBER TO FOLLOW THE WAY OF THE HORNED GOD: DON'T TAKE LIFFE TO 
SERIOUSLY, DON'T BOTHER ABOUT FAILURE OR SUCCESS AND KEEP COOL WITH OTHERS 
          OKAY, NOW ALLELUYA BROTHER, AND WRAP IN PEACE.............. 
BLOOK BLOOK ZOGOTUNGA, WRAPED
